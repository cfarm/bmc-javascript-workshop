# Teaching notes

The lecture will present how JavaScript is used to make websites interactive. Students will use programming basics
including functions and data types to build their own interactive website by editing the DOM (Document Object Model).

## Goals

- How JavaScript works in web browsers
- How to use JavaScript to add interactivity to webpages

## Outcomes
- Understand front-end versus back-end code
- Understand how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript fit together;
- Familiarity with basic computer programming concepts (functions, variables, data types)


## Questions for students

How many of you have ever made a website?
Written HTML?
CSS?
JavaScript?
Written code in another programming language? Which ones?


## Todos for outline

Class 1 topics, one example of each, reduce exercises to save time. Remove more complex exercises.

DOM - intro to what the DOM is and how JavaScript can interact with it. Show examples using forms + events.

For more advanced examples like a form with submit event, add comments to the code to explain what's happening so we can skip that concept to save time. Link to lessons on coding sites for more practice/deeper learning.

Add puzzles.html and warmup.html exercises to slides. Link to them for students who want to explore and practice more beyond class.
