# Teaching notes

The lecture will present how JavaScript is used to make websites interactive. Students will use programming basics
including functions and data types to build their own interactive website by editing the DOM (Document Object Model).

## Goals

- How JavaScript works in web browsers
- How to use JavaScript to add interactivity to webpages with the DOM

## Outcomes
- Understand front-end versus back-end code
- Understand how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript fit together;
- Familiarity with basic computer programming concepts (functions, variables, data types)


## Questions for students

How many of you have ever made a website?
Written HTML?
CSS?
JavaScript?
Written code in another programming language? Which ones?

## Outline on board if there is one

- Key concepts: data types, variables, functions, the DOM, events
- Data types we will learn: strings, numbers, 

## Todos for outline

### Rm/edit:

- Class 1 topics, one example of each, reduce exercises to save time. Remove more complex exercises.

- skip intro go-round slide

### Add:

- explain console - add slide


#### DOM 
- intro to what the DOM is and how JavaScript can interact with it. 
- Show examples using forms + events.
- dom slides
- add object data type description after "Dom Access" slide before "Dom Access: by id"
- remove HTML5 slide
- use alert/console examples at beginning before DOM stuff
- explain innerHTML code and use that to put stuff on page moving forward

For more advanced examples like a form with submit event, add comments to the code to explain what's happening so we can skip that concept to save time. Link to lessons on coding sites for more practice/deeper learning.

Add puzzles.html and warmup.html exercises to slides. Link to them for students who want to explore and practice more beyond class.
